This week I had to make a panel with results from 5 different [`brms`](http://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) models in R. The `ggplot2` allows you to do `facet_wraps` to create a panel with multiple plots but it also requires that you have a well formated dataframe.

`brms` provides some functions to create conditional effects plots. The plots are ready and can be easily customized with `ggplot2`. While the package offers functions to retrieve the data frame, I did not want to recreate the plots. They were already fine.

As a solution comes the excelent package [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/). This package allows you to place plots in a grid with many customizations. 

In this post, I will walk through the steps to make the final figure below:

The first step is to generate each plot individually, as you want them to look like. E.g. for the first plot (top-left). The `mm_f` is the name of the `brms` model.

```r
habits_ff <- plot(conditional_effects(m_ff, effects="fa_habits",categorical = T))[[1]] + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1)) +
  labs(x="Habits",
       title = "FF",
       fill = "Response",
       colour = "Response")+
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank())
```

To remove the text labels in the x and y axis, as well as the title of some figures, I removed when plotting each one individually (using `element_blank()` in the theme). E.g.:

```r
subjective_rtsba <- plot(conditional_effects(m_rtsba, effects="fa_subj",categorical = T))[[1]] +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1)) +
  labs(x="Subjective norm",
       fill = "Response",
       colour = "Response")+ 
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_blank())
```

We do that for every plot and in the figure (lots of copy paste). Then we assemble each variable individually with `patchwork`. I used `plot_layout(nrow=1)` to make sure we have only 1 row.

```r
habits <- (habits_ff + habits_rtsba + habits_rtsbb + habits_comb + habits_p2p ) +
    plot_layout(nrow=1)
```

After doing this for every variable (Habits, Climate, Subjective norm, Trust and Control) we can assemble these five panels in a single figure also with `patchwork`. I used the options `collect` to have only one legend and position it in the bottom.

```r
panel <- (habits / climate/ subjective / trust /control) +
    plot_layout(guides = "collect") & 
    theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

I exported everything as pdf A4 figure using the export buttom in the plots panel in RStudio.

I hope that helps others when creating complex but reproducible figures in R (as opposed to gluing them in Photoshop =D).
