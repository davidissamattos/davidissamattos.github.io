As I am finishing now my PhD, I decided it was time to have a personal website with a section to create some small personal blog posts, update my cv etc..

I end up going for the following technologies:

* Static website based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
  * Hugo is simple to use, the pages are written in markdown, it is fast and easy to deploy.
* Hugo theme: [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/)
  * A clean and easy to use theme.
* Netlify for hosting
  * Good support for Hugo with CD, so it is just commiting and pushing to Github and Netlify updates and builds your website automatically.
