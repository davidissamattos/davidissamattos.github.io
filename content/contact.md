### Research

I concluded my Ph.D. in Software Engineering in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technnology (2021). My Ph.D. project was funded by the Wallenberg AI Autonomous Systems and Software program ([WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)) and my research is conducted in close collaboration with industry in the context of the [Software Center](https://www.software-center.se/).

My research has been focused on Software Engineering. However, I have worked and published papers within Data Science and AI, Psychology, Transportation Research, Automotive, Research Methods etc...
