I hope now that I have a bit more time, I can write more here.

In the last few months, I concluded my Ph.D.! The dissertation can be found [here](https://research.chalmers.se/publication/524749) and it is a wrap-up of these last 5 years of publications. 

At the same time, I started my new role as an A/B testing method expert at Volvo Cars, where we will start running A/B testing to continuously improve the software present in our vehicles!

Finally, our paper about the bpcs package was accepted and a new version is available in the Github repository. At Volvo, we use mainly Python, so I decided to create a port of the bpcs package to Python, the [pybpcs](https://github.com/davidissamattos/pybpcs) pacakge. It is still missing quite a bit of features and not fully working but as soon as I have an alpha release I will post here.
