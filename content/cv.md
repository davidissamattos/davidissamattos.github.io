I am working as an A/B testing method expert at Volvo Cars. I aim to bring causal inference and data-driven decision-making into automotive software development.

I concluded my Ph.D. in Software Engineering in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technnology (2021). My Ph.D. project was funded by the Wallenberg AI Autonomous Systems and Software program ([WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)) and my research is conducted in close collaboration with industry in the context of the [Software Center](https://www.software-center.se/).
